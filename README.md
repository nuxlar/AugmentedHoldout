# Augmented Holdout

This mod increases spawn rate and available credits during all holdout events while also reworking/adding to others. Credit Multiplier and Eclipse TeleExpansion are configurable. Planning to rework Void Locus and Commencement to be more fun areas to explore rather than charging stuff.

All Holdouts:
  - Increased monster spawn rate
  - Increased credits for spawning (125% default)

Teleporter Holdouts:
  - Expands to the whole stage when the boss is defeated and charged to 5%
  - Has a config option to enable for Eclipse 2+ (off by default)

Moon Edit:
  - Pillars are optional
  - Pillars drop items

Moon Rework (config):
  - coming soon

Moon Escape Holdout:
  - Removes Lunar Chimera from spawn pool
  - Adds all void enemies to spawn pool (no voidling)
  - Spawns a Jailer and Devastator to start off (accounts for slower spawning)

## Future Plans
- Replace holdout zones with actually fun mechanics specific to each holdout zone type
  - Moon
    - Twip/Gura are the more reasonable scavs spawn either at blood arena
    - You can go up to Mithrix immediately
    - Spawns a Lunar Scav that drops items/lunar coins at blood arena
    - Pillar Rework
      - Blood: Works like a Combined Blood and Chance shrine, possibility of getting items at the cost of your HP (applies curse)
      - Mass: Triggers an event you must complete for a reward
      - Design: Offers a 50/50 chance to reforge a broken item or break an item
      - Soul: Offers a 50/50 chance to give a buff or a debuff
  - Void Locus
