# Augmented Holdout

This mod increases spawn rate and available credits during all holdout events. Credit multiplier is configurable.

All Holdouts:
  - Increased monster spawn rate
  - Increased credits for spawning (+25% default configurable)

Moon Edit:
  - Pillars are optional
  - Pillars drop items

Moon Escape Holdout:
  - Removes Lunar Chimera from spawn pool
  - Adds all void enemies to spawn pool (no voidling)
  - Spawns a Jailer and Devastator to start off (accounts for slower spawning)
