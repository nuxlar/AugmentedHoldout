# Augmented Holdout

This mod increases spawn rate and available credits during all holdout events while also reworking/adding to others. Credit Multiplier and Eclipse TeleExpansion are configurable. Planning to rework Void Locus and Commencement to be more fun areas to explore rather than charging stuff.

All Holdouts:
  - Increased monster spawn rate
  - Increased credits for spawning (125% default)

Teleporter Holdouts:
  - Expands to the whole stage when the boss is defeated and charged to 5%
  - Has a config option to enable for Eclipse 2+ (off by default)

Moon Escape Holdout:
  - Removes Lunar Chimera from spawn pool
  - Adds all void enemies to spawn pool (no voidling)

## Future Plans
- Replace holdout zones with actually fun mechanics specific to each holdout zone type
  - Lunar/Void Pillars
    - Divide into different areas with incentive to explore and clear rather than making it mandatory
    - Twip/Gura are the more reasonable scavs spawn either at blood arena
    - Maybe lunar pillars have set options similar to a chance based buff/debuff event system
